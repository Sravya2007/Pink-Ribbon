## **Intro**
### A simple, unique app to spread awareness among women about breast cancer. We empower women to take charge of their health by encouraging breast self examination (BSE) every month.

## **Salient Features**
- ### üéØ Targets women mainly of the age group 20 and above
- ### ü§© Simple yet catchy UI and ease of interaction
- ### üî• Powerful backend with Firebase
- ### üóíÔ∏è Informative home screen with resources about breast cancer
- ### ü™ú Step-by-step guidance for performing BSE
- ### ü©∫ Analysis of test results and showing nearest doctors

## **How to test?**
- ### Clone or download this repository from GitHub to your local machine.
- ### Install Node.js on your computer, if it is not already installed.
- ### Run the command `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
- ### Install the Expo CLI globally by running the command `npm install -g expo-cli`.
- ### Download the Expo Go app on your mobile device from the App Store or Google Play Store.
- ### Launch the Expo Go app on your mobile device and scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or browser window that opened after running `expo start`.
- ### Wait for the app to build and load on your mobile device. You should now be able to test the app on your device.
### **Note:** You may not be able to test the app because config.js (containing firebase configuration) is missing. You can create a new firebase app, or if the config.js file has been shared with you, add it to the project directory and then test the app.

## **Future Plans**
- ### We plan to expand our app to deal with breast cancer in men
- ### In tier 2 or tier 3 cities there may not be any breast oncologists available. We need to add a feature to suggest a general physician/gynecologist to users in these cities
- ### We need funding to be able to publish our app on the playstore or app store
- ### We also need funding to enable the push notification service, so that our users can receive timely notifications to do their BSE
